# LD48.DearChild

![DearChild](./docs/preview.png)

Welcome ! [DearChild](https://deformhead.github.io/LD48.DearChild/index.html) ([Ludum Dare 48 Theme: Deeper and deeper](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/ld48-dearchild)) is built in plain HTML5/JavaScript with a framework I am developping.

I challenged myself creating this game in only 24h instead of the regular 48h !

## Overview

This is a narrative experience more than a game that I enjoyed working on !

This was my third Game Jam, so I hope you'll like this game. Thank you for your support.
